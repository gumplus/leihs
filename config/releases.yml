    ### Adjustments and Bug Fixing

    **Missing translations**
    - When submitting an order in the borrow section in the German part, the success message has now been translated to German.
    - Tab "return" in German part of leihs has now been translated to German

    **Borrow section**
    - The filter settings are not deleted anymore when switching from one category to another

    **Lending section**
    - Feature delegation contracts: When searching for a user, not only his own contracts are shown in the overview but also contracts of delegations, where this user is acting as borrower.
    - Bug fixing: Adding an item or model is not case sensitive anymore. This bug was introduced with the PostgreSQL-Update
    - Bug fixing: It is not possible to lend the same item at the same time to the same user.
    - Bug fixing: Date field when editing the calender in the return page was buggy. Now it is possible to delete the date or type a new date

    **Manage section**
    - Feature duplicate items: If you save an item where the serial-nr. already exists in leihs, you receive a warning asking, if you really want to save. This should help keep your inventory "tidy".

    **Admin section**
    - The shown time in the Audits-Page has been corrected to show the current time
    - The newest entries in the Audits-Page are now shown on the top

    **Installing leihs V4**
    - Enabling LDAP  in V4: How-to-documentation adjusted to enable LDAP under PostgreSQL
    - We now provide the possibility to create the first leihs-Admin-user through a UI
